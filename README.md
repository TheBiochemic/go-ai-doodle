# go-ai-doodle
Little Project for learning Go based on an AI, which lives as Humans on a World and collects Resources for their Homes


# get started
Run with 
```
go run *.go
```

as Impelon suggested in https://github.com/TheBiochemic/go-ai-doodle/issues/1 :

this works for Windows:
```
go build -buildmode=exe
```

The Project runs in the Console and rovides you with status updates about the things, that the people are doing

The Project ends and gives you an overview of everything, what has happened

you can vary the output, when you use different start parameters in the form parameter=value

- maxpeopleperhouse (how many people should spawn per new house)
- mapsizeareas (how many areas should the map be sized; an area is 32x32)
- resourceperarea (how many resources should be scattered around the map)
- motherloadpercentage (how many percent should the motherload of resources contain)
- buildingcount (how many buildings to start)


have fun ^^
